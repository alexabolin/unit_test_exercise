## Introduction
This repository contains code for calculating the expected y_coordinate when given an x_coordinate on a defined line and plane. The repository also contains a test file, which has been run and fully passed by the program. The program is written in Python and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Specifications 
The program runs the `new_y` function, which takes in 3 parameters: `plane_input_1, plane_input_2, new_x`. The first two define the line and the plane on which the new coordinate will be calculated. The third parameter takes in the x coordinate the user would like to input. The function then returns the corresponding y coordinate.
